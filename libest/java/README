This directory contains the JEST project, which is a reduced functionality 
reference implementation of a Java EST client using a JNI layer to libEST. 
At this time, it has been decided that no further development will be done 
on JEST. For users who require a more robust implemenation of EST in Java,
projects like Jester (https://github.com/jscep/jester) which aim to be 100%
compatible with libest would be a suggested alternative (Please note that 
this is not an endorsement for Jester and we will not provide support for it).
JEST requires you have a JDK and Apache Ant installed on your system.

Getting started
---------------
1.  Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of your JDK
2.  ./configure --with-ssl-dir=/your/path/to/install --with-safec-dir=/your/path/to/install --prefix=/where/you/want/it/installed --enable-jni
    make clean
    make -j4
    make install
3.  Navigate down to the src directory and type:
    
    ant
    ant -f buildjar.xml

    To build the javadoc:

    javadoc -d ./doc -sourcepath . -subpackages com -exclude com.cisco.c3m.est.test.DT:com.cisco.c3m.est.test.UT
