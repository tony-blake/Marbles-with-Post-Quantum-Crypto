This entire directory of unit test code started from US901 @2003 on 11/14/2013.  Changes
were made to support the proxy function being tested instead of the EST server function.

//These are the commands used to generate CSR file (req.p10).  
//The OpenSSL config file came from Max's EST prototype code
openssl req -new -nodes -out test.req -keyout test.key -config demoClient/demostep2.req.cnf
openssl req -in test.req -outform DER | openssl base64 -e > req.p10
