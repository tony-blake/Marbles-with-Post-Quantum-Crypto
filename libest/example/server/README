This directory contains a sample EST server application.  It utilizes
Mongoose for the web server, OpenSSL 1.0.2 for the SSL stack to be used
with Mongoose, libest for the EST stack, and OpenSSL for basic CA
services. 


DISCLAIMER:  This example code should not be used "as is".  
             The CA server used by the example was taken
	     from the OpenSSL example code.  It has not been tested 
	     to comply with X509 requirements for operating as a 
	     certificate authority.  There are known issues with the
	     OpenSSL CA, such as the basic constraints are not checked
	     when signing a certificate request.  Additionally, the  
	     OpenSSL CA implementation is not thread safe.
 


To run the example:

1.  Ensure libcrypto.so and libest.so are in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    Here's an example:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib:/usr/local/est/lib

2.  Run the createCA.sh script to create the sample CA database.
    This only needs to be done once.  This will create the estCA
    directory, which contains the CA database.

3.  Run the runserver.sh script to start the server.  The server
    will listen on port 8085.

4.  Use an EST client to exercise the server.



Certificate Revocation
----------------------
libest supports CRL checks when verifying the client certificate.
To use this, the CA cert chain file, which is a PEM file, should have
the CRL records appended to it.  To generate the CRL, follow
this example:

    # revoke a certificate, repeat as needed
    openssl ca -config ./estExampleCA.cnf  -revoke certtorevoke.pem 
    # generate the CRL
    openssl ca -config ./estExampleCA.cnf  -gencrl -out crl.pem
    # append the CRL to the CA certs
    cat crl.pem >> estCA/cacert.crt 


TLS-SRP support
---------------------
To enable TLS-SRP use the --srp switch when starting estserver.  You'll
need to provide the SRP verifier file to be used.  This can be generated
using OpenSSL.  An example follows:

    touch passwd.srpv
    openssl srp -srpvfile passwd.srpv -gn 1536 -add jsmith
