This directory contains a minimal EST client application.  Unlike the
other example client application that allows granular control over
the individual EST operations, this example code shows how the
individual operations are used together during the certificate
provisioning process.  This README assumes the EST server is
listening on the local host using port 8085.  The EST process works 
as follows:

    - First the /cacerts request is sent to the server
    - Next, the /csrattrs request is sent to the server
    - The local application creates a certificate request (CSR)
    - The CSR is sent to the server and a X509 cert is returned.
    
To build the example on Windows:

Prerequisite: EST sample applications make use of the GNU getopt library for command line 
              argument parsing. The getopt library is not a part of the C library provided with
              Microsoft Visual Studio. An open source port for getopt exists under the LGPL3 license 
              and must be acquired separately at the link provided below:
              http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/157001/Full-getopt-Port-for-Unicode-and-Multibyte-Microso
              Download the archive which provides the two source files getopt.c and getopt.h and place both 
              source files into the "util" directory.

1.  Set the following environment variables to tell the Gradle build script 
    where to find your installations of OpenSSL and EST

    EST_DIR - must contain the est.lib link file and est.dll binary
              
    set EST_DIR=C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\EST
    
    SSL_DIR - must contain an "include" subdirectory for the OpenSSL header files,
              a "bin" subdirectory for the OpenSSL dll binaries, and a "lib" subdirectory
              for the OpenSSL link files
    
    set SSL_DIR=C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\OpenSSL
    
    PATH - must contain the path to your Visual Studio 2013 VC bin directory 
           prior to any other Visual Studio bin directory and the path to 
           your Gradle executable (which should already be in PATH)
           
    set PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin;%PATH%
    
2.  From the "example" directory, type:

    gradle -b build_examples.gradle clean
    
    to clean out any prior builds and then:
    
    gradle -b build_examples.gradle build
    
    to build both estclient and estclient_simple executables.
    The executables are placed in the directory shown below:
    
    example\build\exe\estclient\estclient.exe
    
    example\build\exe\estclient_simple\estclient_simple.exe
           
To run the example:

1.  Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include the directories where libest.so
    and libcrypto.so are installed. For example... 

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/ssl/lib:/usr/local/est/lib
    
    On Windows, set the PATH enviromnent variables to where 
    libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll are installed and where est.dll 
    is installed.
    
    set PATH=C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\EST;C:\PathToYourLibraryInstalls\OpenSSL\bin;%PATH%

2.  Set the following environment variable to specify the location
    of the file containing the CA certificates used for verifying
    the server.  In this example we use the trusted certs for
    the example EST server:

    export EST_OPENSSL_CACERT=../server/estCA/cacert.crt

3.  Connect to the EST server listening on port 8085 and request a 
    new certificate.  The example EST server uses the user ID and
    password estuser/estpwd:

    ./estclient_simple  -s 127.0.0.1 -p 8085 -u estuser -h estpwd  

    Note: The user ID and password are hard-coded in this example.  
          There is currently no way to change the user ID presented 
	  to the EST server.


After successfully provisioning a new certificate, the following
files are generated in the current working directory:

    newcacerts.pkcs7 This file contains the latest copy of
                    the CA certifications from the EST server.
    cert-b64.pkcs7  This file contains the newly provisioned
                    certificate.
    new_key.pem     This file contains the new keypair that
                    was generated when creating the certificate
		    request.  This contains the private key that
		    matches the public key in the new cert.

Use this command to view the new CA certs returned by the server:

    openssl base64 -d -in ./newcacerts.pkcs7 | \
        openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -text -print_certs

Use this command to view the new certificate from the server:

    openssl base64 -d -in ./cert-b64.pkcs7 | \
        openssl pkcs7 -inform DER -text -print_certs
